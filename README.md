This is a template for what is in this template at least an accessible WCAG 2.1 compliant HS Football schedule, 
though obviously you can use it for anything. 

Copy the <tr> table rows to create additional entries. Also change TEAM_NAME to your team's name in <caption>

Does not include images. It looks like this:

![football_SS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/999a1fdf-28c3-4204-a75f-7fed4a9952aa)

You can use it for your district site. 
I'm not responsible for anything resulting from use and with changes can in no way ensure compliance.

Cheers,
Mike
