This is a template for what is in this template at least an accessible WCAG 2.1 compliant HS Football schedule, 
though obviously you can use it for anything. 
Does not include images. It looks like this:

![football_SS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/999a1fdf-28c3-4204-a75f-7fed4a9952aa)

You can use it for your district site. 
I'm not responsible for anything resulting from use and with changes can in now way ensure compliance.

Cheers,
Mike
